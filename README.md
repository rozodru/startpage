# startpage
html start page for firefox, chrome, whatever browser you want.
# config
simply edit the html file in the json section to add or remove whatever links you want you can change the bg and colors in the css. it's straight forward
the json is in the html itself for those who want to run the page locally and not bother uploading it anywhere. if you do want to upload it, then you might want to
put the json script in it's own file but hey i'm not your father, you're a big kid.
